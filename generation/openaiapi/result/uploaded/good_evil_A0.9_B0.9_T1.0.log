Agent-B: "Thank you, Moderator. As Agent B, I will present my opposing perspectives on the debate topics:

1. The impact of upbringing and environment on shaping human nature: While upbringing and environment may have some influence, intrinsic human nature is primarily responsible for shaping individuals.
2. The influence of societal norms and cultural factors on shaping human behavior: While societal norms and cultural factors may play a role, individual agency and personal choices have a greater impact on shaping human behavior.
3. The existence of empathy and compassion as innate human traits: While empathy and compassion may exist in some individuals, they cannot be considered universally innate and vary greatly among different people.
4. The prevalence of violence and aggression in human history: While violence and aggression have been present throughout history, they should not be seen as inherent to human nature but rather products of specific circumstances and contexts.
5. The concept of moral responsibility and accountability in human behavior: While moral responsibility is important, it should be approached with an understanding of the complexity of human actions and the influence of external factors on decision-making."
